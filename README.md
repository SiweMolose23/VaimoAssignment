# FE Technical Assignment

Application for Front-end developer role at Vaimo

## Installation

Can be run in any IDE that has React.js, Axios and Node.js 

## Summary
The technology stack includes React.js and CSS was used for the design. I chose to try and learn React.js because that is the stack used at Vaimo. While I attempted to make use of LESS, I scrapped the idea because I wanted to focus on React.js. If I could change anything I would have done the assignment in a language I'm familiar with first before jumping into React.js
